# Mess Management System
## Overview


We have built a web application based on a college/hostel mess. It will provide a common platform to both mess staff and students. In that application mess admin/staff will be able to manage its staff/employees data, manage students data, manage its inventory (record for items used in mess), manage its purchase of items (whenever mess staff purchase some item, its quantity will be updated in inventory or if the item is new, then it will be added), display weekly menu on the portal for students. In this application students can view the weekly menu provided by the mess. They can lodge complaints if they have any kind of issue. Complaints will be resolved by mess staff. Students can also give their feedback according to quality of food, hygiene etc.
